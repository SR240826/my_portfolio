            With the introduction of AI like midjourney, stable diffusion, dall-e, the creative community is alarmed. Some of it is due to 
            the violation of IP rights and some are scared for job scarcity. But I am not here to discuss all that. Rather I am here for the
             satisfaction of making something myself. 
            <br><br>
             This was one of my work from last year. I wanted to make something on the above topic. It was done with limited time. A lot of 
             time was spent on gathering reference. Most of my 3D works are related to real life object. So it was new to me to do everything from 
             scratch. For the limited time, I wanted to limit the scope of works as well. I was not good with sculpt that time. But still pushed 
             myself to learn some brushes and use it.

            My work pipeline for this project was creating base model in blender which includes sculpting and retopology as well. Then the modelâ€™s normal, 
            AO, displacement was baked inside substance painter. The full texture was done inside painter as well. I love how it makes texturing easier which 
            includes masking most of the time.

            In this project I used UDIM and RGB-grayscale-packed texture as well. A lot of artist or clients tends to ignore or been unfamiliar with these methods. Some even make 
            it sound way much complicated. But it is really easy to use and with the modern graphics advancements, the advantage should be leveraged.
